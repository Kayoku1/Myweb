<p class="mytext">I have no idea what should i do with this page yet, i have alot of crazy ideas that i am thinking about like many links and each link is a website i created<br>
and each website i created is a very unique and wierd website on its own. I am planning to add music to each website to fit it unique vib and also that it wont be that boring.<br>
each website will be wierd and also some of them will be dark, there will be many hidden links inside the each page and the hidden links will go to the dark websites i crearted.<br>
in each website i will try to be the most creative as i can and not steal commen pics and artworks of people, i will try be creative with my photoshop skills.When i will finish studying how to<br>
create a website i may start studying python and also try adding more wierd and my own original stuff to this website.</p>
